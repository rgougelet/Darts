The biggest issue with these data are that the trials are of variable length. EEGLAB is unable to deal with this easily, as far as I know. Instead the epochs are all referenced using the latency files generated by the "2_get_trial_latencies" script. The 0_preprocessing script implements basic preprocessing steps like relabeling channels, the highpass filtering the data, and etc.
